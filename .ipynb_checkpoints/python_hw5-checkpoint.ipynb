    "# Your parking garage class should have the following methods:\n",
    "# - takeTicket\n",
    "# - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",

    "# - payForParking\n",
    "# - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
    "# - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
